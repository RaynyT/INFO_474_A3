            <h3> Dataset: Unemployment rates for persons 25 years and older by educational attainment</h3>
            <p> <b>About the dataset:</b> Our dataset comes from the <a href="https://www.bls.gov/"> U.S Bureau of Labor and Statistics </a>site which hosts many datasets and visualizations to be explored about various elements that the Bureau collects. For instance: unemployment and the associated elements like the reason for unemployment as well as duration from household data and employment information from industry which includes hourly wages and weekly hours. As our team explored the many datasets this site contains, we gravitated towards unemployment rates for persons 25 years and older by educational attainment that is seasonally adjusted. This data set intrigued us because it showcases these rates over the years of 2001 to 2021 and this period includes the recent pandemic that has impacted the world. Since this data included information throughout the pandemic, we wanted to explore how COVID-19 impacted the unemployment rates for this age period and how the education levels compared for this age group. This data specifically came from personal reporting from the household and not from industries and was gathered anonymously to protect peopleâ€™s privacy. This data also showcases the percent distribution for each month which could provide interesting findings when aggregated or filtered. Interestingly though, if one were to sum all the reported educational rates, we can see that they will not usually sum to 100% and this is because not everyone submits information to the US census this, we must consider that this data does not account for all the U.S. population. Since our question focuses on 2018-2021, we included slide bar functionality to highlight the important information that would answer our question. It is clear from the data that the hierarchy of the education levels does showcase a pattern for unemployment rates but what is not visible from the raw data, is the disparities and polarizations between these four educational levels, thus this is something we will touch on in our analysis.</p>
            <p> <b>Analysis questions:</b> What were the unemployment rates 12 months before COVID-19 started compared to the unemployment rates in the 12 months after COVID-19 started or in other terms, how have unemployment rates been impacted in the US due to COVID-19?</p>
            <p><b>Analysis Topics:</b>
                <ul>
                    <li>Disparities/Polarization Between the Education Levels: Did the gaps lessen or increase?</li>
                    <li>Peaks/Troughs: Were there any noticeable changes in unemployment around the time COVID-19 impacted the world and the U.S.?</li>

            <h3>Final write-up</h3>
            <p><b>Rationale for our design decisions:</b> Since we were interested in seeing the unemployment 
            rate before the pandemic compared to 1 year after the start of the pandemic, we thought that a line 
            graph would nicely represent/display the comparison. This is because it enables us to see the progression 
            of unemployment from year to year. Beyond that, the line chart allows us to see different high and low 
            points of unemployment rates. </p>
            <p><b>Overview of work distribution:</b> It was really difficult to split the work among group members 
            since we are all working on the same visualization/chart. Though, we found a way to collaborate in that we had 
            one person lay down the groundwork in creating the original chart/axis and parsing through the data. Then we assigned 
            different features like displaying the line chart, filtering checkbox, and slider year to different individuals. 
            Below is how we split up the work. Individuals with higher level difficulty features were able to focus on just that feature.

            <p><b>Overview of the development process:</b></p>
            <p><b>Alex commentary on the development process:</b> When we first met as a group, our first order of business was to figure out which dataset we were going to use. From the 3 different datasets we used, we decided to focus our efforts on the field of Unemployment in America. Unfortunately, the dataset one of our group members originally used was flawed. This required us to go find another dataset that we could visualize with relative ease. The dataset we landed on was still in the realm of Unemployment, but it was more specific (Unemployment across degrees for the past 20 years). From there, we decided on the question we wanted to ask about our data and listed some of the features that would be necessary to answer said question. From the list of 4 features, we ranked them in terms of importance and separated the top and bottom half into two groups (Must have and Nice to have) We assigned ourselves to our desired tasks and set out to work. For me specifically, I chose to work on a slider that would allow us to filter the data based on year. While I was able to get a basic slider in at first, I became stuck when I tried to incorporate our own data into the slider. This was a result of the date data in our data set being in an unusual format, and not wanting to separate month from year. I worked with Akoly and Rayna on how we could potentially solve this issue. While we were trying out different ideas to make the slider work, Akoly found that just using a regular slider seemed to work better and take in our values easier than a React Slider.</p>
            <p><b>Akoly commentary on the development process:</b> we ensured that everyone was working on their own feature branch and enforced pull requests to ensure main code quality which is nice because all features in the main branch works and nothing is broken. From layouting the groundwork for the project, I found that there was an issue with the way our data was formatted specifically with the month and year data, so I had to parse through that using the d3 time parse function. From a lot of googling and with the help of Kevin, it probably took me around 2 hours to parse and  display the data on the x  and y axis. Beyond this, I also helped with deploying the app and creating the extra slider feature with two other group members. Working together on the same feature proved to be a little bit difficult in that we had a lot of merging conflicts and trying to resolve that took almost as long as developing the feature itself. </p>
            <p><b>Kayla commentary on the development process:</b> Our first decision when starting to work on A3 was what dataset we were going to use. We ended up going with unemployment rates based on education level. Afterwards, we met several more times as a group to discuss what question we wanted to explore with the data, what interactive features we wanted to include and how we could split up the work accordingly. Based on research and examples that we found, we decided to develop a line graph showing the unemployment rates based on different education levels and include the ability to show and hide different lines and zoom in on different parts of the data. We decided that these two interactive aspects were must-haves for our data visualization, and that hovering on the line could be a nice to have feature if we had extra time. In creating the line graph, I had created a line graph for my A2 assignment, so my group was able to use part of my code as reference when developing the graph. I also decided to help work on the showing and hiding lines interactive feature by implementing a checkbox feature. I had to research how to implement it and took a look at multiple different websites and examples to implement it. Overall, it took me around 2-3 hrs to implement the checkbox interactivity. </p>
            <p><b>Rayna commentary on the development process:</b> For my assignment 2, I chose to utilize data that touched on educational rates for people in the U.S. The analysis I portrayed consisted of discussions regarding the disparities and polarizations between the educational rates within the U.S. This data was extremely interesting to me because I wanted to see how time changed how the U.S. thought about and responded to education. It was clear from my analysis that from the 1970s to 2018 there had been a significant increase in the popularity of education. While my dataset did not contain information for the years during the pandemic, I expressed the interesting takeaways I gained from my analysis in A2 which inspired our pursuit of obtaining education level data including the years 2020 and 2021. Since I primarily focused on utilizing Tableau for A2 I was open to exploring many methodologies that we could leverage to highlight meaningful realizations from the dataset. These methods included functionalities like a checkbox, line chart, hover, zoom, and slider. Of these functions, we established that the line chart would be the best way to display the data and information we wanted to convey and aligns well with sequential or time variables. Additionally, we established that the checkbox was a necessity in order to display only one educational level at one time. Currently, we are still attempting to implement the slider functionality in order to emphasize certain time periods which would cater to our question since it only focuses on the year before and after COVID-19. For the Slider, I helped Alex and Akoly debug on how to make it appear on the webpage and function properly.</p>
            <p><b>Jisu commentary on the development process:</b> When our group decided to create a data visualization for A3, we referred to Raynaâ€™s dataset which is the unemployment data by degree level. And, we wanted to connect the data with the Covid-19 period, for example, how Covid-19 impacts the unemployment rate. For the data visualization with this topic, we came up with an idea for the functionalities such as checkbox, line chart, hover, zoom, and slider. Because the dataâ€™s values are changing depending on the time and there are four different degree levels. Therefore, we decided to create the line chart as a base of data visualization. And, checkbox, hover, and zoom are similar together, so we have unified our views with checkbox functionality to see the specific degree level of the unemployment rate. Also, to check the unemployment rate at pandemic, we discussed creating the slider.  To create the lines with four different degree levels, it took 3-4 hours to filter the data. However, after Akoly created the x-axis and y-axis, It was much easier to render the line on the webpage. I think I spent less than 2 hours creating the lines. Also, I edited the y-axis to match our dataset. After creating the lines, I tried to implement a checkbox, so in order to find the way to create the checkbox, I spent over 2 hours researching and testing the code with ours. However,  I was not able to connect lines with the checkbox. So, I asked Kayla for help to connect the checkbox with lines.</p>
